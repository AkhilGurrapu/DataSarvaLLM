## Project Overview

This project explores and compares the capabilities of various newly released large language models (LLMs). Our focus is on evaluating these models in a chat application context, providing insights into their performance, nuances, and usability. The models included in this study are:


- **Snowflake-Arctic**: A model designed for high-performance conversational understanding.
- **Meta-Llama3-70B**: A state-of-the-art language model known for its ability to generate human-like text.
- **Meta-Llama3-8B**: A smaller version of the 70B model, optimized for more efficient processing.
- **Mistral-8x22B**: Known for its unique training approach and scalability.
- **Google-CodeGemma-7B**: A model tailored for coding and technical discussions.
- **Google-Gemma-7B**: Similar to CodeGemma but generalized for a broader range of topics.

Each of these models represents cutting-edge advancements in AI language processing, developed by leading organizations in AI research.

## Features

- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate the conversational abilities of each model on a set of standardized prompts.
- **Performance Metrics:** Analyze response time, coherence, and relevance of responses from each model.
- **User Experience Testing:** Gather feedback from real users interacting with the models to assess practical usability.
